# FastAPI_RecipeScrapper
This is a python application that calls a server hosted on an Azure that allows users to query for recipes with different information filters and post/update/delete recipes. The API calls developed on the server are made with python FastAPI. Only client.py needs to run since the server file is already running on Azure.
